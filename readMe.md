# Summer Project - JS (with PHP, SQL and maybe TWIG)

## Recreate my existing JS games :-

 - **Keep the code tidy**
 - **Definitely have efficient code!!**
 - **Tailwind or Bootstrap (As I'm going to do the Blog Project using TW, I'll use BS here)**
   - Alternatively, create it with pure CSS (must be pretty and responsive to screen size!)
 
## Include

- The new version of Snake but make the background prettier
- Remake Minefield
- Remake Memory Game (existing isn't bad but will improve the code)
- Remake Simon
- Make a Cookie Clicker (with collaboration of class?)

### Leaderboards

- User login/creation necessary for leaderboards
- Ranking for each game
- Possibility to view leaderboards with different sorting (by: game, player, score, etc)

---

### Final Challenge: Make the games playable on mobiles
